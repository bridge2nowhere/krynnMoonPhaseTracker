# Krynn Moon Phase Tracker
This program tracks the three moons of Krynn. Useful for Wizards & Moon Sorcerers (if they can escape the Towers of High Sorcery. Years given are all AC, negative years would be PC, but I haven't tested them.

## Useage
"Up/Down" changes the day
"Left/Right" changes the year
"A" changes the moon

## Try it
You can run an emulated version with ProjectABE here: https://felipemanga.github.io/ProjectABE/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridge2nowhere/krynnMoonPhaseTracker/main/KrynnMoons.hex

You can also get an Arduboy and run it at the gaming table here: https://www.arduboy.com/

## Future Plans
+ Add Month Names
+ Add a way to switch between the different month names (e.g. Solomnic, Dwarven, Elven)
+ Add Graphics
+ Setup/Test PC years

The calendar and phases are following the work of Tobin Melroy which I found at http://dragonlance.d20.cz/clanky/243/2317.html on 4 Sept 23
